# You mentioned to make the color schemes same as other terminals.
# This often implies using a pre-defined theme. However, I can't
# automatically detect or apply themes from other terminals.
# For now, I've set the foreground color as requested.
# You might want to uncomment and configure a full color scheme here if needed.
# For example:
# background = "0x1E1E2E" # Example dark background

# [colors.normal]
